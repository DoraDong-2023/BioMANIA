# Web access online demo

We provide a colab demo [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14K4562oeesEz5qMoXmjv9gW_4VeLh6_U?usp=sharing) and an [online demo](https://biomania.serveo.net/en) hosted on our server! 

# Quick start

We provide several ways to run the service: terminal CLI, Docker, railway, python script, colab demo. Among those, terminal CLI is the easiest way to start. \

## Setup dataset and models
```bash
# setup the environment
pip install git+https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA.git  --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
# setup OPENAI_API_KEY
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-xxxx"' >> .env
# download data, retriever, and resources from drive, and put them to the 
# - data/standard_process/{LIB} and 
# - hugging_models/retriever_model_finetuned/{LIB} and 
# - ../../resources/
pip install gdown==5.1.0
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nT28pIJ_dsdvi2yD8ffWt_aePXsSWdqI
sh download_data_model.sh
# setup the PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

## Run with terminal CLI or gradio app

```bash
# CLI service quick start!
python -m BioMANIA.deploy.cli_demo
# or gradio app. (TODO 240509: Images showing are under developing!)
python -m BioMANIA.deploy.cli_gradio
```

## Run with Docker

For ease of use, we provide Docker images for several tools. You can refer the detailed tools list from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/chatbotuibiomania).

```bash
# Pull back-end service and front-end UI service with:
docker pull chatbotuibiomania/biomania-together:v1.1.9-${LIB}-cuda12.1-ubuntu22.04
```

Start service with
```bash
# run on gpu
docker run -e LIB=${LIB} -e OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_openai_api_key] --gpus all -d -p 3000:3000 chatbotuibiomania/biomania-together:v1.1.9-${LIB}-cuda12.1-ubuntu22.04
# or on cpu
docker run -e LIB=${LIB} -e OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_openai_api_key] -d -p 3000:3000 chatbotuibiomania/biomania-together:v1.1.9-${LIB}-cuda12.1-ubuntu22.04
```

Then check UI service with `http://localhost:3000/en`.

Important Tips for Running Docker Without Bugs:
- To run docker on GPU, you need to install `nvidia-docker` and [`nvidia container toolkit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). Run `docker info | grep "Default Runtime"` to check if your device can run docker with gpu.
- Feel free to adjust the [cuda image version](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags?page=1) inside the `Dockerfile` to configure it for different CUDA settings which is compatible for your device.

We understand the desire to run the service on a server and visualize locally. You can initiate the [ngrok service](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) by running this script on your server:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

then get the url like `https://[ngrok_id].ngrok-free.app` and copy it to chrome to start!

## Run with Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/qaQEvv)

To use railway, you'll need to fill in the `OpenAI_API_KEY` in the Variables page of the biomania-backend service. Then, manually enable `Public Domain` in the Settings/Networking session for both front-end and back-end service. Copy the url from back-end as `https://[copied url]` and paste it in `BACKEND_URL` in front-end Variables page. For front-end url, paste it to the browser to access the frontend.

## Run with script

This section is provided for user who want DIY more flexible function.

For instance, let's take `scanpy` as an example. Detailed library support information can be found in the [Q&A](./docs/Q&A.md)

### Setting up for environment
To prepare your environment for the BioMANIA project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA.git
cd BioMANIA
conda create -n biomania python=3.10
conda activate biomania
pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `BioMANIA/.env` file.
```bash
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-xxxx"' >> .env
```

- For inference purposes, a standard OpenAI API key is sufficient.
- If you intend to use functionalities such as instruction generation or GPT API predictions, a paid OpenAI account is required as it may reach rate limit. 
- **Feel free to switch to `model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125'` or `gpt-4-0125-preview` in `src/models/model.py` if you want.**

### Prepare for Data and Model
Download the necessary data and models from our [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BRoq007udu8QH-lwTwCkaFZfG69amB01?usp=drive_link). For those library data, you can download only the one you need.

We provide a script for downloading models and datas from Google Drive for scanpy as an example. This works if you are accessible to google.
```bash
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nT28pIJ_dsdvi2yD8ffWt_aePXsSWdqI
sh download_data_model.sh
```

Organize the downloaded files at `BioMANIA/data` or `BioMANIA/hugging_models` as follows (`base` are necessary):
```
data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ others-data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ standard_process
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_composite.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scanpy
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_composite.json
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {LIB}
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_composite.json
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

hugging_models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retriever_model_finetuned
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {LIB}
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

../../resources
```

By meticulously following the steps above, you'll have all the essential data and models perfectly organized for the project.

We also offer some demo chat, you can find them in [`./examples`](https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA/blob/main/examples). Notice that these demo chat are converted from the PyPI readthedoc tutorials. You can check the original tutorial link through the `tutorial_links.txt`.

![](./images/demo_full.jpg)

### Prepare for front-end UI service

This is compatible with Node.js version 19.
```bash
# Under folder BioMANIA/chatbot_ui_biomania
npm install && npm run build
```

### Inference with pretrained models

Start both services for back-end and front-end UI with:
```bash
# Under folder `BioMANIA/`
# backend, in one terminal
python -m src.deploy.inference_dialog_server
# frontend, in another terminal
cd chatbot_ui_biomania/
npm run dev 
```

Your chatbot server is now operational at `http://localhost:3000/en`, primed to process user queries.

> **When selecting different libraries on the UI page, the retriever's path will automatically be changed based on the library selected**

### DIY

```bash

## Run with gradio app

```bash
# under BioMANIA/
from src.deploy.model import Model
conversation_started = True
model = Model(logger=logger, device='cpu', model_llm_type='llama3')
user_input = "Could you load the built in dataset?"
library = "scanpy"
# for the first dialog, use conversation_started=True, then conversation_started=False
model.run_pipeline(user_input, library, top_k=1, files=[], conversation_started=conversation_started, session_id="")
```

## Build your APP!

Please refer to the separate README for tutorials that supporting converting different coding tools to our APP.
- [For PyPI Tools](./docs/PyPI2APP.md)
- [For Python Source Code from Git Repo](./docs/Git2APP.md)
- [For R Package](./docs/R2APP.md) (231123-Still under developing)

## Share your APP!

If you want to share your pretrained APP to others, there are two ways.

### Share docker

You can build docker and push to dockerhub, and share your docker image url in [our issue](https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA/issues/2). For environment setting of your tool, please refer to `BioMANIA/docker_utils/{LIB}/` to add the env files, or modify the Dockerfile to build your environment.
```bash
# cd BioMANIA
docker build --build-arg LIB=[your_tool_name] -t [docker_image_name] -f Dockerfile ./
# (optional)push to docker
docker push [your_docker_repo]/[docker_image_name]:[tag]
```

Notice if you want to include some data inside the docker, please modify the `Dockerfile` carefully to copy the folders to `/app`. Also add your PyPI or Git pip install url to the `requirements.txt` before your packaging for docker.

### Share data/models

You can just share your `data` and `hugging_models` folder and `logo` image by drive link to [our issue](https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA/issues/2).
