  - Support sharing your APP and install others' APP through [our issue](https://github.com/batmen-lab/BioMANIA/issues/2)!
  - Enhance code robustness: 
    - When it returns a tuple, split it to multiple variables by adding code `result_n+1, result_n+2, ... = result_n`. 
    - During parameter inference, if a parameter is of 'NoneType', replace it with 'Any' to run smoothly.
    - Fix bug for adding quotation when user input value for str type parameters.
  - Release a package.
